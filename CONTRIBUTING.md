Contributing
============

Thanks for your interest in helping to improve `meadowlark`! If there's an
open issue that you think you can help close, do get stuck in; please comment
that you're intending to tackle it, though, to avoid duplication of work.

Proposals
---------

If there's a feature you'd like to see added in the theme, then either:

 - If you can implement it yourself, then fork, modify and submit a pull
   request. There's currently only one branch; I'll update this if that ever
   changes.

 - If you would like someone (anyone!) else to tackle it, open an issue. Please
   tag with Bug or Enhancement as appropriate, so that I can prioritise fixing
   broken things over adding new ones. If you're not sure whether it fits or
   not, tag as Question.
